# Prog01. rstrip() remove the space characters at the end of the string. Create a program that do the same functionality without using rstrip() function.

# 1. Ask for the user input
string_input = input("Input anything with spaces at the end: ")
# 2. Simply print as is because the spaces at the end wont matter anyways.
print(string_input)
